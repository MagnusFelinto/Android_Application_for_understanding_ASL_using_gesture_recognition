# Android-Application-for-understanding-ASL-using-gesture-recognition
An Android Application that uses gesture recognition to understand alphabets of gesture recognition 

With a rising demand in disability solutions, sign language recognition has become an important
research problem in the field of computer vision. Current sign language detection
systems, however, lack the basic characteristics like accessibility and afordability which
is necessary for people with speech disability to interact with everyday environment. This
project focuses on providing a portable and afordable solution for understanding sign
languages by developing an android application. The report provides a summarisation
of the basic theory and steps involved in developing this android application that uses
gesture recognition to understand alphabets of American sign language. The project uses
different image processing tools to separate hand from the rest of the background and
then implements pattern recognition techniques for gesture recognition. A comprehensive
summarisation of the results obtained from the various tests performed has also been
provided to illustrate the efficacy of the application.
